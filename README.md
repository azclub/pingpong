# Ping Pong Scoring Tracker
Keep track of ping pong scoring. Cause I can't remember the scoring when I am in the game and I got a lot of free time to kill.

## Phase 1
Record and stream Video

Good reference
http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/27041/record-and-stream-video-from-camera-simultaneously

Requirement:
I need video streaming to setup the camera and debug.
I need to record videos to build the score tracking software in phrase 2

Nice to have:
I need motion detect feature which does the following:
- Send email to me when active.
- Upload video to dropbox when the pingpong session is end.

## Phase 2
I've got the video of ppl playing ping pong. Let's build the software so it output correct scoring.

## Phase 3
The minial requreiments are finish. Let set it up in the ping pong room and see how it goes.
